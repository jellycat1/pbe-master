        <p class="about-text"><b>About PBE Master</b><br><br>PBE Master was created by a Pathfinder who combined his love for the Pathfinder Bible Experience and computer coding to make it easier for others to study God's Word. Having just gone through his first year of PBE of 2024-25, he was encouraged to create a tool that would find practicing Scripture study and quiz more enjoyable and easier for everybody. During the summer of 2025, he dedicated his days to developing this app—translating his own experience as a Pathfinder into something others who share the same passion for studying the Bible in depth might benefit from.<br><br>This was a task in which the entire team participated. His family and his PBE partner, Joshua, helped him to review and edit hundreds of quiz questions diligently to ensure that they were correct and to-the-point. What began as a summer coding project has become a community tool written by Pathfinders, for Pathfinders—designed to help anyone prepare with confidence, grow in knowledge, and be drawn closer to Scripture.</p>
